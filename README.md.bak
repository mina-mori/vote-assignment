Vote App

The application is a single page application which is divided in three sections. On the first section, the 
user can create a poll with up to 10 options. In the central one, the user can vote by selecting one of 
the options and pressing the "vote" button. On the right, the chart will update based on the 
questions created and the votes that each question got.
